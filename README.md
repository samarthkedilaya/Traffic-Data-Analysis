# Traffic-Data-Analysis

## Objectives:
+ To analyse changes in traffic congestion during weekends over a period of 7 to 10 years. 
+ To observe and analyse any plausible relationships between incidents and traffic congestion during weekends. 

## Approach:
The idea is to analyse weekend traffic congestion on each of the highways using data available on portal. The data is collected using sensors placed at different milestones/stations on the highways. We assume that there exists congestion when the average speed of  all vehicles passing through a station is low. The project hence uses average speed to define congestion at different stations on the highway.  

By using the congestion data on each of the highways, a heat map is generated with the help of tableau. X- axis of the graph is time period and Y axis on the graph is the milestone value. The graph gives an idea of varying congestion over a time period at every station on the highway. A similar data and heat map is collected for the incidents that occurred on the highway. These incidents shall be plotted on the previously generated heat graph. 

Initially a set of three highways (I-84 Westbound; US 26 Eastbound; I-205) are taken and the data is analysed over a time period of one year. The final goal of the project is to develop a methodology to generate above described heat maps for any given highway across any time period.  

## Team Structure:

The team has three members. Alex, Samarth and Raghu. The idea is to work together at every step of the project and learn from each other. However, for achieving better outcomes we decided that each of us will take a lead on specific parts of the project and guide others. Below is a rough breakdown. 

+ Alex: Congestion data analysis 
+ Raghu: Incident data mapping and analysis 
+ Samarth: Visual representation of data and pattern recognition. 

## Project Milestones:

1. Traffic data collection and creation of tables. 
2. Heat map generation for one highway taking one year data (I-84 W)
3. Mapping incidents on I-84 west to the generated heatmap. 
4. Generate heat maps and plot incidents for 7 years on I-84 Westbound; US 26 Eastbound; I-205. 
5. Come up with a methodology to generate heat maps and plot incidents  for any given highway across any time period.  
6. Analyse the graphs and note important patterns/observations. (Also a  sub milestone at every stage from step 2)
